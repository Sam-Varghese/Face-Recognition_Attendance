## Features

- Automatically captures images of people for facial recognition.
- Integrated with MySQL database which enables this program to update records in real time.
- This program leverages Convolution Neural Networks, Tensorflow, Data Augmentation for the most accurate predictions.
- Model is saved after it's trained everytime which enables the user to re-run the saved model instead of training it again and again on images of all users.
- All the tables in MySQL are well connected and efforts are being taken constantly to reduce redundancies to max extent.
- Entity Relation diagram is also maintained.
